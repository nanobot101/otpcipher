# otpcipher
Nancy Onyimah's OTP Cipher Repository

This program takes a file input and generates a One Time Pad, a string of upper case letters. It then reads the ascii values of each of these upper case letters and uses those values as indexed shift values for each character of the encrypted message. It also includes a decryption function that reverses this encryption, revealing the original message.
